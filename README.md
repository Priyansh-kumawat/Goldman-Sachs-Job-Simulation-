This is one of the Job Simulation I did at Goldman Sachs .
I was able to gain valuable knowledge in Microsoft excel and its business perspective.
Here I tried to assist a virtual client, a cupscake shop to gain insights about their business plan for upcoming 5 years.
I took reference of some assumptions and i tried to upload all of them in attached files .
Try all the tasks and get some hands on skills in excel.
